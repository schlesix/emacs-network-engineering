# emacs-network-engineering
- This should someday become an helpful extension for the GNU Emacs text editor.
- The code is not that good because I'm just a beginner in Emacs LISP.

## Current features
### *format_mac*
- This functions transforms a marked valid MAC address into the Cisco format (xxxx.xxxx.xxxx)
- There's currently no key binding.
